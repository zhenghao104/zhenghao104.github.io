      <p class = "description"> The sales distribution of each items in each of the five region. As you can see from the graph there was a dip in sales at October 
          2018 when burger king released their new burger. We can see that it does affect the sales slightly after the introduction of impossible burger. The trend
        for each item are pretty consistent across the five regions and hamburger remains the most popular item followed chicken fillet and fish fillet. </p>

      <p class = "description"> A red vertical line is drawn at October 2018 when burger king released the impossible burger. We can see that there is a slow increase
        in growth for each of the product before burger king release the impossible burger. After the release of the impossible burger it seems that each of the products
        did not manage to reach the peak sales compared to before October 2018. Based on the sales trend some event may happen in October 2018 that cause the decrease in 
        sales and growth of all the products. The introduction of impossible burger from burger king may or may not be the causation. There may be correlation but we need
        to have more experiement to verify whether causation exist, if possible. An important thing to note here is causation does not mean correlation. There may be other
        major events such as change of price or other external influence that we did not account for that affect the sales of our product. I will not conclude that impossible
        burger is the causation of our drop in sales just with these graphs.

        shows the performance for each product across the US.

      <h2 class="subHeading">Average sales in each region on different day of the week</h2>
      <p class="contact"> This shows the average sales in different day of the week in January 2016<a href="#"></a></p>
      <div id="regionChartDay"></div>
      <script src="regionChartDay.js"></script>
      <p class="description"> The stacked bar chart above shows the average sales in each day of the week for all product during the time period of January 2016.
        We can see that the sales in each region varies slightly and Friday has the highest sales compare to the other days of the week. For NorthEast region it has 
        the highest sales on Thursday and for the other four regions Friday has the highest sales. The sales on the weekend for some regions are not as high as weekdays
        sales which can advise the marketing department to change their strategy and promotion. There can be more promotions to encourage customer to visit the restaurant
        in the weekends or reward the loyal customers that regularly visit the restaurants during the weekdays. Different region has a slightly different pattern of visiting
        the restaurant and it may be worth trying to have different marketing strategy targeting each region.

      <h2 class="subHeading">Average sales in all region on different day of the week</h2>
      <div id="dayLineChart"></div>
      <script src="dayLineChart.js"></script>
      <p class="description">This shows the average sales in different day of the week in January 2016. As we can see from the graph the restaurant has the lowest sales in 
        the weekend compared to weekdays. It is computed by taking the average sales for each of the week to avoid bias as the data may have more frequency of some days of
        the week compared to other days. This graph can help the marketing strategy to think about their promotion and sales on different day of the week. The previous stacked 
        bar chart can help the company to think about the strategy for a specific region, and this graph provide an overrall view on the performance across the US.

      <h2 class="subHeading">Average sales each month in each region</h2>
      <div id="regionChartMonth"></div>
      <script src="regionChartMonth.js"></script>
      <p class="description">This shows the average sales in different month of the year in from Jan16 to Sep19. Similar as previous stacked bar chart, it allows us to 
        see the peak season for sales for each region. The peak season for NorthEast region is May, and for the rest of the region it will be August.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subHeading">Average sales each month in all region</h2>
      <div id="monthLineChart"></div>
      <script src="monthLineChart.js"></script>
      <p class="description"> This shows the average sales in different month of the year in from Jan16 to Sep19. This graph shows that August has the highest sales 
        compared to other months and October has the lowest average sales. This result can help the marketing team to make decision on when to release their new promotion 
        targeting for summer season and possibly holiday season to increase their sales other months. As October has the lowest sales, marketing team may think of 
        promotion such as halloween special to boost their sales.

      <h2 class="subHeading">Average sales distribution each month in all region</h2>
      <div id="regionPieMonth"></div>
      <script src="regionPieMonth.js"></script>
      <p class = "description"> This shows the distribution of the average sales for all region in different month of the year in from Jan16 to Sep19. Although the previous 
        graph shows that August is the peak season, the share of the slices between each month actually do not differ much as we can see from the pie chart above. The difference
        is small that it is difficult to differentiate between the size of the pie without looking at the numbers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subHeading">Average sales distribution each day in all region at Jan16</h2>
      <div id="regionPieDay"></div>
      <script src="regionPieDay.js"></script>
      <p class="description"> This shows the distribution of the average sales for all region in different day of the week in at Jan16. We can see that Friday has a slightly 
        bigger shares. The difference between the slices do not differ much as it is difficult to differentiate between the size without looking at the numbers similar as 
        the previous pie chart.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subHeading">Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="description"> Overall we can see that the fall of sales of burgers match the timeline of the introduction of impossible burger. Therefore we have reasons
      to suspect that the impossible burger is affecting the market for our company. We gave some suggestion and graphs above that hopefully can help the CEO and marketing
      to decide on the next step.</p>
